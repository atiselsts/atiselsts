### Hi there

I'm an IoT researcher at [EDI](https://www.edi.lv/en/) (https://github.com/edi-riga/).

In my free time I sometimes explore web3 — Uniswap and others.

### Collaboration 🤝

Get in touch if you're interested discussing a research & development projects on:

* embedded software and protocol development (Contiki-NG, TSCH and others)
* web3 (Uniswap analytics)

In addition to contract research, I'm always open to collaborate on funding proposals (Horizon Europe and others) on IoT, wearables, low-power communication protocols, and similar.

### For students 🎓

I'm looking for enthusiastic students interested in embedded software development and research. I'm offering supervision for undergraduate and master thesis projects on IoT or DeFi topics.

### Contacts 📫
